                <p>To my amazing Man,</p>
                <p>Today marks the 5<sup>th</sup> month that we've been together. I wanted to not just tell you how much you mean to me but put together something small that showed our journey together. I also wanted this to be a website so that whenever you're feeling lonely or having doubts, that you'll always have something from me to hold onto. That'll show you time and time again that it's you and me against the world. As you scroll through the pictures. I hope they bring you the same joy as they brought to me.</p>
                <p>Within 5 short months, we've gotten to know each other so deeply. I feel as though you're a part of me. My other half, that missing peice. I love the way that you rest your head on my chest when you're exhausted from playing fortnite. I honestly can't believe I met someone who shares so many of my values and goals. I mean like... someone who is vegan, wants to live in a Tiny House and adores pwning noobs in video games? How can someone just be so right? It always brings me back to when you told me, "Those love songs that you'd hear finally start to make sense."</p>
                <p>This is only the beginning of our journey together. In a few more months we'll be living it up in Dallas. Sharing laughs and amazing times with your family, making new friends, traveling all over the world and exploring what we can really do when we let our imaginations run lose. I'm really looking forward to see what our future holds in store for us.</p>
                <p>Here's to you, to me, to happily ever afters.</p>
